              We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Services from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including

          <div class="heading">Purchases</div>
          <span>
            <strong>In App Purchases</strong> From time to time, MTJF may offer products and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by MTJF (each, a “Software Store”). If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your Software Store (“your IAP Account”), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in app purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in app purchases that apply to your IAP Account. Some Software Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase, your IAP Account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the MTJF application from your device. Deleting your account on MTJF or deleting the MTJF application from your device does not cancel your subscription; MTJF will retain all funds charged to your IAP Account until you cancel your subscription through your IAP Account.<br>
            <strong>MTJF Online Purchases</strong> If you choose to make a purchase through MTJF Online, you agree to pay MTJF all charges at the prices displayed to you for the services you’ve selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments, and you authorize MTJF to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). MTJF may correct any billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, MTJF may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion.<br>
            If you purchase a subscription through MTJF Online, your subscription will continue indefinitely until cancelled by you. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing, until you cancel. You agree that your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature. <br>
            You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting MTJF Online and going to “My Profile.” If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.<br>
            <strong>Coins Purchase:</strong> From time to time, you may be able to purchase, with “real world” money, a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use “Coins,” which can be spent to receive premium features in the MTJF app. You are only allowed to purchase Coins from us or our authorized partners through the Service and not in any other way. Coins represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Coins obtained by you are licensed to you, and you acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to Coins is being transferred or assigned to you. This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in the Coins. Any Coins balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. Coins do not incur fees for non-use, however, the license granted to you in Coins will terminate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, when MTJF ceases providing the Service or your account is otherwise closed or terminated. MTJF, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Coins and/ or may distribute Coins with or without charge. MTJF may charge different rates for the purchase of Coins depending on time, geographical region, or any other method at its discretion. MTJF may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Coins at any time. MTJF shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that MTJF exercises any such rights. The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, and you shall not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer Coins to any person or entity. Coins may only be redeemed through the Service. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF COINS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. The provision of Coins for use in the Service is a service provided by MTJF that commences immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase of such Coins. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MTJF IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
          </span>
          <div class="heading">Refunds</div>
          <span>Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. Purchases of Virtual Items like Coins are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.</span>
          <div class="heading">Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement</div>
